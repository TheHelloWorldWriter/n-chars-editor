# N Chars Editor

This is a simple web-based text editor that I created to help you write text with a specific character limit. I often need to write software descriptions, app store listings, headlines, and other text content where the length is constrained, so I built this tool to make that process easier. It's a "Hello World" style application, meaning it's intentionally simple and built with basic web technologies.

It also can be a learning resource for those new to web development. The code is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks. I've also added comments throughout the (although very simple) HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to explain how it works.

You can find the live version of the editor at [nchars.thehelloworldwriter.com](https://nchars.thehelloworldwriter.com/).
